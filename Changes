Revision history for NetworkInfo::Discovery and related modules:
----------------------------------------------------------------

0.08  Wed Jan 15 13:04:28 EST 2003
    - Added Scan.pm.  This can be used to scanl ranges of ipaddresses for
      open tcp or udp ports.
    - Added tests to test Scan.
    - Changed the way Discovery->add_host works.  Now tries to log a 
      changed attribute.
    - Added changed Host attribute "open_ports" to be "tcp_open_ports" or
      "udp_open_ports".  Also fixed them so that they can accept a string
      to get around reading in the host from a file.
    - Added pod to Scan.pm
    - Ran podchecker on Discovery.pm, Host.pm, Scan.pm, and Detect.pm.

0.07  Wed Jan  8 23:28:42 EST 2003
    - Finished off the first attempt at acls.  look at the test.pl or example/sample.pl for examples.

0.06  Tue Jan  7 15:20:14 EST 2003
    - added "do_it", "add_host", "add_hop", "get_hosts", "get_hops" functions to "Detect.pm".
    - Updated to reflect this: Sniff.pm, Traceroute.pm, and the test scripts.

      Mon Jan  6 17:58:43 EST 2003
    - added the acl_match function.  hope to add acl entries soon, then I can stop mapping the whole internet.

      Thu Jan  2 19:07:35 EST 2003
    - Added a few more bits of info to Host.
    - The Discovery server is now marked so so that we can find it easily later. 

0.05  Mon Dec 30 10:33:49 EST 2002
    - Modules renamed as NetworkInfo:: for CPAN

0.04  Fri Dec 27 13:09:14 EST 2002
    - Added find_host and get_host to Discovery.pm.  This allows you to
    locate a host in the graph and to make a new C<Host> out of a few
    query attributes.
    - Added a TODO file, in case someone wants to join in the effort here.

0.03  Mon Dec 23 17:45:46 EST 2002
    - Added documentation to Net::Discovery and Net::Discovery::Host
    - Added dependencies into the Makefile.PL so they should get caught
	on a perl Makefile.PL

0.02  Sun Dec 22 20:07:28 EST 2002
    - Added Net::Discovery::Detect.  This should now be subclassed to 
	write detection modules.  Look at ::Traceroute and ::Sniff for 
	examples.
    - Added Net::Discovery::Sniff.pm to sniff ethernet traffic.
    - Added Net::Discovery::Traceroute.pm to pick up hosts and hops
	between end points.
    - Added tests for all of the above.
    - Added the ability to add edges to the network graph with weights
	based on latency.
