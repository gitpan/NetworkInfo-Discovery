    query attributes.

    - Added Net::Discovery::Detect.  This should now be subclassed to 
	write detection modules.  Look at ::Traceroute and ::Sniff for 
	examples.
    - Added Net::Discovery::Sniff.pm to sniff ethernet traffic.
    - Added Net::Discovery::Traceroute.pm to pick up hosts and hops
	between end points.

	based on latency.
