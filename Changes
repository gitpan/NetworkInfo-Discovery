Revision history for NetworkInfo::Discovery and related modules:
----------------------------------------------------------------

0.10 Wed Feb  5 12:20:17 EST 2003
   x Added a pre-alpha version of a Tk front end to display the network
     in all it's glory.  this was for nothing... see next note. will
     need to redo this for the new register.
     
     Fri Feb 14 12:24:38 EST 2003
   - Switching from using Graph as the internal representation.  It is 
     too slow, and memory inefficent.  Will now be using my own
     "Register" that allows faster access and information to be better
     agregatted.  This means most of the modules will be changing.
   - Sniff was updated to reflect the change.

     Wed Feb 19 16:25:54 EST 2003
   - Moved the ACLs from Discover.pm to Register.pm.  Newly found 
     interfaces are checked against the ACLs as they are added to the
     register.  You can still check by hand, but this is a time saver
     for me.
   - Added methods for reading and writing the register from and to a
     file using Storable.  This should be in the core perl distribution
     for most folks.
   - Made changes to all the examples to reflect the new Register.
   - Made changes to all the detection modules, and Detect.pm to work
     with the new register.

0.09 Wed Jan 15 16:42:05 EST 2003
   - added a temporary hack to Traceroute.pm to prevent traceroute from
     getting a broadcast address.
   - Added "does_icmp" to Host.pm... I thought it was there... maybe 
    I cut it by accident.

0.08  Wed Jan 15 13:04:28 EST 2003
    - Added Scan.pm.  This can be used to scanl ranges of ipaddresses for
      open tcp or udp ports.
    - Added tests to test Scan.
    - Changed the way Discovery->add_host works.  Now tries to log a 
      changed attribute.
    - Added changed Host attribute "open_ports" to be "tcp_open_ports" or
      "udp_open_ports".  Also fixed them so that they can accept a string
      to get around reading in the host from a file.
    - Added pod to Scan.pm
    - Ran podchecker on Discovery.pm, Host.pm, Scan.pm, and Detect.pm.

0.07  Wed Jan  8 23:28:42 EST 2003
    - Finished off the first attempt at acls.  look at the test.pl or 
      example/sample.pl for examples.

0.06  Tue Jan  7 15:20:14 EST 2003
    - added "do_it", "add_host", "add_hop", "get_hosts", "get_hops" functions
      to "Detect.pm".
    - Updated to reflect this: Sniff.pm, Traceroute.pm, and the test scripts.

      Mon Jan  6 17:58:43 EST 2003
    - added the acl_match function.  hope to add acl entries soon, then I can
      stop mapping the whole internet.

      Thu Jan  2 19:07:35 EST 2003
    - Added a few more bits of info to Host.
    - The Discovery server is now marked so so that we can find it easily
      later. 

0.05  Mon Dec 30 10:33:49 EST 2002
    - Modules renamed as NetworkInfo:: for CPAN

0.04  Fri Dec 27 13:09:14 EST 2002
    - Added find_host and get_host to Discovery.pm.  This allows you to
    locate a host in the graph and to make a new C<Host> out of a few
    query attributes.
    - Added a TODO file, in case someone wants to join in the effort here.

0.03  Mon Dec 23 17:45:46 EST 2002
    - Added documentation to Net::Discovery and Net::Discovery::Host
    - Added dependencies into the Makefile.PL so they should get caught
	on a perl Makefile.PL

0.02  Sun Dec 22 20:07:28 EST 2002
    - Added Net::Discovery::Detect.  This should now be subclassed to 
	write detection modules.  Look at ::Traceroute and ::Sniff for 
	examples.
    - Added Net::Discovery::Sniff.pm to sniff ethernet traffic.
    - Added Net::Discovery::Traceroute.pm to pick up hosts and hops
	between end points.
    - Added tests for all of the above.
    - Added the ability to add edges to the network graph with weights
	based on latency.
