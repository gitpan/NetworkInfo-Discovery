=head1 NAME

NetworkInfo::Discovery - Modules for network discovery and mapping

=head1 DESCRIPTION

NetworkInfo::Discovery is a set of modules that can be used to discover network 
topology, interfaces on the network, and information about the links between subnets.
This information is brought together into C<NetworkInfo::Discovery::Register> 
where it can be examined and used to build a unified map of the network.
The network map is controlled from a single location.

Host detection currently runs from a single location, but in the future
there will be support for having remote agents that contribute to the
central map.

=head1 MODULE LAYOUT

NetworkInfo::Discovery consists of several modules that all into three categories:

=head2 Register

The Register maintains a full picture of the network.  Anything that is discovered 
should be put into the Register where little details can be used to build the 
larger picture.  

=head2 Network Objects

These are the things about your network that you want to discover.  Namely, interfaces, 
subnets, and gateways.  See L<NetworkInfo::Discovery::Register> for details about what
attributes these have.

=head2 Detection Modules

These modules should all be a subclass of C<NetworkInfo::Discovery::Detect>.
It is their job to detect interfaces, gateways, and subnets that can then be 
fed into the register.  The following are the existing detection modules:

=item Sniff 

is a passive monitor that listens to ethernet traffic on the
local sement to build a list of Hosts.

=item Traceroute 

is used to map interfaces and gateways using traceroute.

=item Scan 

is used to probe ip addresses or ranges of ip addresses for open tcp or udp ports.
