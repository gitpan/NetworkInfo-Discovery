Keep in mind this is very alpha code. 

This project is my first atempt to make a GUI drawing of a graph.  It
uses perl-Tk to display the graph and conenctions, as well as a bit of
information about the hosts on the network.  It needs to be modified to
know the location of your network xml file.  

In the future I would like to expand on this, so if anyone out there
does Tk programming, feel free to add more depth here.
