NetworkInfo/Discovery 
==========================

NetworkInfo::Discovery	is a toolset for the discovery of network hosts 
			and topology.  This module handles discovered 
			hosts.  It can save and restore the the known hosts.

NetworkInfo::Discovery::Host	represents all that we know about a 
				discovered host.

NetworkInfo::Discovery::Sniff	is a discovery module that sniffs the local
				segment to discover information about hosts.
				
NetworkInfo::Discovery::Traceroute is a discovery module that maps the hops
				   from the local segment to other know
				   hosts, helping to show us the topology.

NetworkInfo::Discovery::Scan	is a discovery module that scans ranges of
				ip addresses for open ports, and to detect
				new hosts.
